## What is it ?

Daily dev is an extension for browsers, that replaces your "new tab" page with the daily.dev feed. You can personalize your feed as you want, by following different technology-related topics. There are a lot of subjects, some global, like web development or, more precisely, around one technology like JavaScript or Go.

They believe that with this extension, developers will always be updated on the technology they use, and are going to learn and interact with others. It's a very nice website to use as a Junior developer, to chat with more experienced people and learn from their feedback.

## The fame

But there is something very singular about daily.dev: you start with a fresh account at 10 points of reputation, and reputation is primordial on this website. It allows you to suggest sources and post articles in general or in public squads. And there are some way to increase it, and it's not that easy to exceed the threshold of 250 reputations, which allow you to do mostly everything.

To obtain reputation, you need to interact with people who have already exceeded the threshold of 250. An upvote or a reply from an account with 250 reputation will add 10 reputation to your account. But it's not achieved; if you get downvoted or reported, you'll lose some of your reputation.

Apart from this reputation thing, they give you the possibility to have a "Dev card" which is pretty cool, you can create private squads with friends and share articles together. 

## Why I like the idea...

I think that I'll learn tons of things with this new extension, and I am considering creating a private squad with my friend to share stuff between us. I understand this reputation thing, though. But it's a bit rough, according to me, to prevent new users from posting, but I understand the reasons why they needed a thing like this to rule the website.
