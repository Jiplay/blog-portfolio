# The Tommyknockers : Story 

This book had a big influence on me. Before this book, I was not much of a reader, I used to read everyday tech stuff for my job, but a book ? Not for me.

And The Tommyknockers happened, I bought it at a garage sale, and like the character in the book, my transformation began slowly. Stephen King is the kind of writer you never regret buying his books because his stories are amazing. 

This one is about 2 ex-lovers, a writer and a teacher, a town in the countryside of the United States, and aliens. And the way all those subjects once seen from his point of view make sense and write a different story about themes much more realistic : addictions.

I didn't know before buying this book, even before understanding it during my reading session, that this book is about addictions and how people live with them, with different behaviors and different ends as well.

Bobbi Anderson is one of the main characters in this book. She's a writer, living on the big farm of her dead uncle. She used to live by herself, cutting wood, crafting stuff, and walking a lot with her good old dog Pete. One day, she notices something strange buried in the ground in her garden. Something she's never seen before, and slowly but surely, the desire to know what this is will obsess her.

So she will start digging to know what it exactly is, and at every moment she'll have this strange feeling, “I'm almost there”. This project will start to take all her free time, and then she'll stop eating and sleeping until she understands that the thing, buried in the ground, whatever it is, has an effect on her. She'll start to know her new limits.

At the same time, Jim Gardener, another main character in this *amazing* story, is living his life peacefully compared to what he experienced in the past. He was an alcoholic, and shot his own wife,  when he was drunk and woke up in a cell, not knowing why. But this is the past, now he's giving literature courses. One day, he will join a party of important people, and he will kill the host of the party.

This event will be the trigger for his life, going from this peaceful state, to something like hell. He'll get wasted after this event and will try to commit suicide, but before jumping into the void, he has one thought : Bobbi, his old student, lover, friend, and much more, is in big danger, and he's the only one who can help her. So he'll try to call her, without success, and will try to go to her place. 

After big troubles, he's finally there, and he can't recognize his old friend, she's skinny, she works all day in the garden, and her place seems to have changed. She's now energetically independent and has a stand-alone typewriter.

He'll try to reason with her, but it's already too late, and before he'll notice, he will get sucked into his past addictions and vegetate. Slowly, all the town will act like her and will consider her a leader and the person with the most finished transformation. In one state, Gardener will be reduced to slavery and will work on this project because he seems immune to the effects for unknown reasons.

We'll follow how the *effect of the thing* has an impact on the villagers through stories inside the main one. I think it was a very nice initiative and helps to understand that everyone is touched by this *thing*

After some twists and turns, Gardener will finally manage to get out of his situation and save what can be saved at this point. This will lead to an epic part of the book, where everyone in this town is crazy and Gardener has a target on his back at this point.

# The Tommyknockers : My word 

I really liked this book, and it rekindled the flame of my reading soul, and I'm so grateful for that ! I would recommend this book for anyone; it's not especially scary or difficult to read; you just let yourself follow the flow of the story and get addicted to it.

# Cool thing to know 

This book was released in the first part of the career of Stephen King, and its main theme, addiction, was inspiring for him for a good reason. Before this book, the author was addicted to alcohol, drugs and medicines, but thanks to his wife Tabitha, he will get rid of those demons and write this book.
