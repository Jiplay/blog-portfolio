# The Tommyknockers : Story 

This book had a big influence on me, before this book, I was not much of a reader, I used to read everyday tech stuff with my job, but a book ? Not for me.

And The Tommyknockers happened, I bought it in a garage sale and like the character in the book, my transformation began slowly. Stephen King is the kind of writter you never regret buying books from him, because his stories are amazing. 

This one is about 2 ex lovers a writer and a teacher, a town of countryside of America, and Aliens. And the way all those subjects once seen from his point of view make sense and write a different story about themes much more realistic : addictions.

I didn't know before buying this book, even before understanding it during my reading session, this book is about addictions, and how people live with them, different behaviours and differents ends as well.

Bobbi Anderson is one of the main character of this book. She's a writer, living in the big farm of her dead uncle. She use to live by herself, cuting woods, crafting stuff and walking a lot with his good old dog Pete. One day, she notices something strange buried in the ground, in her garden. Something she never saw before, and slowy but surely, the want of knowing what this is will obsessed her.

So she will start diging to know what it exactly is, and at every moment she'll have this strange feeling "I'm almost there". This project will start to take all her free time, and then she'll stop eating, sleeping until she'll understand, that the thing, buried in the ground, whatever it is, has an effect on her, she'll start to know what's her new limits.

At the same time, Jim Gardener, another main character of this *amazing* story, is living his life peacefully compared to what he experimenced in the past. He was an alcoholic, and shot his own wife, drunk and woke up in a cell, not knowing why. But this is the past, now this giving literature courses. One day, he will join a party of important people, and he will kill the host of the party.

This event will be the trigger for his life, going from this peacefull state, to something like hell. He'll get wasted after this event and will try to commit suicide, but before jumping in the void, he has one thougth : Bobbi, his old student, lover, friends and much more is encouring a big danger, and he's the only one who can help her. So he'll try to call her, without success, and will try to go at her place. 

After big troubles, he's finally there, and can't recognize his old friend, she's skinny, work all day in the garden and her place seems change. She's now energetically independent, has a stand-alone typewriter.

He'll try to reason with her but it's already too late, and before he'll notice, he will get sucked into his past addictions, and will vegetate. Slowly all the town will act like her and will consider her as a leader, and the person with the most finished transformation. At this state Gardener, will be reduced to slavery and will work on this project, because he seems immune to the effects for unknowns reasons..

We'll follow how the *effect of the thing* has an impact on the villagers through stories inside the main one. I think it was a very nice initiative and helps to understand that everyone is touch by this *thing*

After some twists and turns, Gardener finally manage to get out of his conditions to save, what can be saved at this point. This will lead to an epic part of the book, where everyone in this town is crazy and Gardener has a target on his back at this point.

# The Tommyknockers : My word 

I really liked this book, and it rekindle the flame of my reading soul and I'm so grateful for that ! I would recommand this book for anyone, it's not especially scary or difficult to read, you let yourself follow the flow of the story and getting addicted with it.

# Cool thing to know 

This book was realeased in the 1st part of the carreer of Stephen King, and this main theme, the addictions, were inspiring for him for a good reason. Before this book, the author was addicted to alcohol, drugs and medicines, but thanks to his wife Tabitha, he will get rid of those demons, and write this book.
