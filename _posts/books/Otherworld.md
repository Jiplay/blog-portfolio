# Abbie Emmons : The Otherworld 

I discovered this author by browsing YouTube looking for an atmospheric playlist while working. And after a while, I was curious to discover her content. I found out she was an author, and she advises people on how to write a good story. 

I wanted to know how she tells stories in her books, so I bought her last book, "The Otherworld" and I read it in less than a week. I was very impacted by the story, and I couldn't resist the curiosity of knowing the ending of this story. 

This beautiful story begins on an island, where a lightkeeper lives with her daughter apart from the world, alone on this island with Lucius, their dog. One day, Orca, found a backpack and a cellphone on the beach. She calls one guy named 'Superman' and the story begins...

Superman is going through hell. He tells Orca that his big brother went missing four days ago, and everyone thinks that his brother is dead, but he can't allow himself to think so. So she will search for him on her island, and one night, she will find him

She will nurse him, and they will live together, for sometimes, they will fall in love, but without consuming it, it's an impossible love for so many reasons. But when the younger brother comes to take back his brother from this island, and falls in love with Orca as well, things will get complicated.

He will bring Orca to the "Otherworld", and find back the big brother, but the love between them is still impossible. Then follows a series of events, that will change for the better the characters. This story relates to brotherhood, family, love and philosophy.
