OK, it's been 4 books that I've written about on this blog; two of them are by Stephen King. You might have noticed that I enjoy reading his books. I got this one at the same time as The Tommyknockers, and I decided to put myself in this mood again.

## Context

The beginning of the story takes place in the 1960s. We'll follow Bobbie (again, a Bobbi, yes :D, but this one it's a dude) and his friends John-Sullivan (I'll call him Sully, like in the book) & Carol. They were young at the time, and we're going to follow this group until the end of the story, but in a very interesting way.

## First part of the book

This will introduce our character, the beginning of the story takes place in Maine (the native state of the author, btw). Bobbi is a calm boy who is not very sporty, likes to read, and likes to go out with his friends, but money is always a problem... He lives with his mother, who works a lot and is a bit cruel to him. I'm not going to give more details about this character, but she's not a good mother.
They have an empty ceiling, open on rent, and one day a 50-year-old dude will come to live "upstairs". Bobbi and him, Ted, are becoming friends and soon, he offers a job to Bobbi, read the newspaper for him because he's old.
Ted is having a good influence on Bobbi, and with that money, he will go out with his friends. They will get closer to Carol, and she will become his first 'girlfriend' (idk if the term is correct in english, bc they're kids not really gf/bf but idk )
**One day, something will happen** Carol will get harassed by 3 other kids, who play on the same baseball team as Sully. This day, they will almost kill Carol, but she'll scream so loudly that the boys will flee. Bobbi heard this scream, and will **carry** Carol to Ted's place and Ted will heal her a bit.

## Structure and real subject of this book

In this 1st part, we meet all the main characters, young, and we'll follow them from different points of view. There are some mystical vibes around Ted, that time doesn't affect him, but we learn the real thing of this book much later.
After writing this post, I've searched for who Ted is; it's a character from "The Dark Tower" series. That's why he's so mysterious here, and we won't have any answers regarding him in this book.
For those who skipped the history class about the USA in the 1960s, it's in the middle of the Vietnam War; this is the real subject of the book. How American children with different archetypes will evolve in this context.

## Second part of the book

6 years later, we're following a guy at university, but not any random university, the author studied at this university as well. At this university, there are dormitories, and we meet a lot of people. Our main protagonist, will without being aware of this, will spread an epidemic addiction of Hears (the card game), and this will lead all these boys to failing university, and at this time, this means going to Vietnam.
He will also meet Carol during this time; she'll update us mostly on Sully, saying that it's her boyfriend, but after all, it's just information :)
They will fall in love, and Carol will join a group of people fighting to stop this war in Vietnam.

## Third part of the story

In my opinion, the rest of the book can be squashed into the same category: the consequences of the war. It takes place in 1983, and this part of the story challenges your memory, because most of the boys you've met in the story, will fight in the war together. Some of them will survive, and thanks to their memories, we will understand what they lived there.
They lived through hell, and most of them came back with big injuries. Some are traumatized, like Sully, who is haunted by a woman a guy killed savagely. One of the guys who harassed Carol has gone crazy, and lived a strange life consumed by regret over this act.

## My word

I won't say more about the story; I'll let you dig in for details if one day you have the opportunity. I wasn't expecting this when I saw the cover of the book, but I enjoyed the trip suggested by this book. The characters are cool, and the author knows how to surprise people; that's what I like the most about this guy !
It wasn't easy for me to write this post, remembering all the important details of the story without saying too much. My journey with this book is done; he spent time with me when life wasn't easy, and I really enjoyed its company.
