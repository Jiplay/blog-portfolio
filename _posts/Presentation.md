Explore my professional journey in the folders, encapsulating all my past work experiences. Yet, my expertise extends beyond these roles, enriched by various projectsâ€”personal, educational, and collaborative:

SafeCall: An impactful end-of-studies project, jointly developed with six friends.

CPi Project at Schoolab: A noteworthy venture contributing to my skill set.

Year Abroad in Italy: An enriching experience studying AI and Computer Science.

This Website: A ongoing personal project, chronicling my endeavors.
