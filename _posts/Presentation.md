This article is dedicated to professional JG, I'll describe my education, my professionnal experiences, and the most challenging projects.
It will be updated with time, give me some time to have new experience or ideas and I'll write everything in this post.

The oldest will be at the bottom of the page for more clarity when I'll uptate the page


## 2020 : OXIO : backend developer (6 months)

The year after, I worked again with the same company but in a more independant way. The project changed a lot after the end of my internship, and I was hired to fix a major bug in the system.

For some user of the application, the printed balance of money was not the same that stored in the databases of BrandVNO. The mission of my contract was to estimate the number of account touched by this missunderstanding and save some data in a Google Spreadsheet in order to share it with the team.

In order to monitore this issue, I did a Python script to request all the needed data for this tasks. Thanks to this mission I learned to develop correctly with Python3, and to deliver the cleanest code possible following the best practices like the pep8.

It was the 1st time for me that I used a public API, especially one Google, not the easiest API to have access, with the Auth2 process. But it was the first contact between me and an API.

It gave me more facility to process HTTP request and parse data. I also learned how to work more independantly and how to share progress on the task that I took care of.

## 2019 : OXIO : backend developer (6 months)

I started my 2nd year at EPITECH with this internship, I joined OXIO France for 5 months in 2019. During this period of time, I helped to build the main project of OXIO : BrandVNO.

At this time OXIO was a startup composed by 5 others developers and the main idea was the following : Propose, as a service, the possibility to companies to become a telecom. Using BrandVNO and the white label app developped by OXIO as well.

During these months of work, I learned a lot of things thanks to the caring team that I joined. The project was mainly developed in Golang, so I developped skills in this technologie.

The project was divided in microservices, and it gave me the opportunity to learn some details in the architecture, and explore some different choices across the project. Like there were different databases, but different technologies were used to fill specific needs. Thanks to this I learned how to use MySQL, PosgreSQL and MongoDB and to determine the strenght and weaknesses of all of them.

I discovered how to work efficently in a team of developer, using Confluence and especially Jira to manage the Sprints that we had. I had my 1st merge request at this company, and I learned how to beautify my code by following the best practices.
