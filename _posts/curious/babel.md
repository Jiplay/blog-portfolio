The library of babel, the place where everything is written, the beginning of everything, the story of your life, the exact narration of your death. Everything is in this library, but its opposite as well.

## Concept

This library was described by Jorge Luis Borges in 1941, an Argentinian author, in his novel The Library of Babel. According to its inhabitants, the library is not infinite, because it contains only unique books, but it's huge. 

In the novel, the narrator tells us that a book in this library is composed of 25 characters, 22 letters, a space, a dot, and a comma. Books are found on shelves, which are on the walls of the hexagonal rooms of the library. Each book has a title composed of 25 characters, 410 pages, filled with 40 lines, and 80 characters on every line.

## Story

The inhabitants of this library consider it like their universe, where they're born and where they're supposed to die. The narrator is about to die, and he shares with us what it is like to live in this universe composed of hexagonal rooms full of books. 

Once they determined that every book was unique, a huge wave of hope and adventure filled the hearts of the men. A lot of them left their native hexagon to find the promise book, the one that would explain the story of the library. 

Then, this hope was followed by a massive depression, knowing that all that knowledge exists right here but is still not reachable for any human being. So some of the population started to eliminate the 'useless books'. But once again, it's a failure, because these books exists with a variation of 1 character so it would be impossible to destroy them all. 

They will try harder, with other methods to locate a book that will help them, but without any success versus the finite number, but so huge that the probability that someone will find something interesting is nearly 0; even if this book exists in a lot of copies...

## What the library is ?

I really like this novel—probably my favorite, to be honest—because it relates a lot of different feelings and different concepts that, according to me, are fascinating. 

The library is finite, yes. But it hosts every possibility of any book that has been written, and will be written in the future. And this, compared to our human experience of the universe, feels like infinity, but it's not. That's what gave hope to the civilization in the novel, but hope in this case is followed by depression because reality calls back. 

We can determine the number of different books available in the format described in the novel: 25 is the number of different characters available, 410 is the number of pages, 40 is the number of lines on every page, and 80 the character on a single line.

To write down this result, it'll take more than 1 book from the library, and to give this huge number an outsider, the number of atoms in the observable universe is 10x80

## Why do I find this amazing ?

When I discovered this concept, I was filled with the hope the people in the novel felt as well, but after browsing a bit the library, I understood. Everything is written, yes, but it's up to you to make it true. Because everything and its opposite are written in this library, so it's up to you to live and show the world which one is the truth.

By browsing the library, we hope to find answers to a question we didn't think about. We hope to find an easy way to answer a big problematic. But shortcuts don't exist in this life, and it's only after knowing exactly what you're looking for in the library that you're able to find what you already found out.

## Computer science

This concept is amazing from a software engineer point of view, infinite book, generated in a procedural way. Impossible to store all this data, but able to specific generate books. A lot of people have developed software for browsing the library, but this version is by far the most famous, developed by Jonathan Basile : **https://libraryofbabel.info/**

I invite you to browse it, to feel the infinity of the books.
