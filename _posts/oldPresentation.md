This article is dedicated to professional JG, I'll describe my education, my professionnal experiences, and the most challenging projects.
It will be updated with time, give me some time to have new experience or ideas and I'll write everything in this post.

The oldest will be at the bottom of the page for more clarity when I'll uptate the page


## 2023 : Meta Football Leage : Fullstack developer

I work currently in this company, in a part time position, 3 days a week according to my 5th year at EPITECH. 

I developed a stand alone project with an innovative purpose, generate photo realistic soccer player using AI and stable-diffusion. In this project, there is the possibility of generating thousands of players, and moderate all the images generated, in order to select which are conform and which aren't.

I developed this project in Typescript, using Next.JS and deployed it using Vercel


## 2022 : Erasmus : Calabria

I spent 1 year in University of Calabria in Italy, I followed master courses in english from the "Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science" master.

### Data warehouse and Vizualisation 

In this course given by Giorgio Terracina, we learned all the steps from the dataset to the setup of a data warehouse and how to exploit the data the best way possible.

I used a dataset provided by Florence consulting group an italian company about the visitors of their website. I cleaned the data thanks to Pentaho, store them in a postgreSQL database and did some charts using the software Tableau.


### Massively Parallel Programming on GPUs

In this course given by Donato d'Ambrosio, we learned how to do parallele programming on the Nvidia GPUs. We developed in C cuda.

For the project, I developped using different configuration, a simple fluid flow simulator based on the Cellular Automata computing paradigm.
And then compare the performance in order to see the impact of parallele programming.


### Process Mining

In this course, given by Valeria Fionda I discovered the concept of process mining. Thoses skills weren't technical but very interesting to explain how things works to someone who is not technical.

I shared a project with another student, and together we explained the process of design a new model of a luxury car. We did different kind of schema, apply different algorithm, check the conformance of results.


### Machine learning

This course, given by Pasquale Rullo and Angelica Liguori, was an initiation to machine learning. 

We developped a model that caracterize houses in different prices categories thanks to a provided dataset. We had different steps in the project like : Data understanding, Data cleaning, Modelisation, Evaluation and Deployment.


### Intelligent system

This course, given by Francesco Calimera, Elena Mastria & Marco Maratea was a course diversifed around intelligent system. I discoverd the PDDL technologie, used for problem solving and with other student developed an algorithm to beat Hypersonic, a coding game representating a Bomberman. We achived the gold division.


## 2021 : Concentus : Lead Developer

In order to finish my 3rd year, I did an internship in this company as a lead developer. My mission was to manage a team of other developer and to develop a solution together.

We worked with Total Energies on the charging point for elecric vehicle project. Our role was to update a part of the project, to fit with the new norms : OCPP 2.0.1. 

Technically, the job was to transfer the "message" from the C++ application, to this open sources project OCPP 2.0.1 developed in Python. And for this we had no restriction.

I explored different solution, the best was to setup a websocket from the package ZMQ and communicate the message serialized. But for this we needed to developed the complexes structure of messages in C++ and in Python. 

To avoid this limitation, we used Protocol Buffer, and this generated the complexe structures for us in both languages.


## 2021 : Schoolab Creation of an Innovative product

During my third year at EPITECH, I joined the CPI project of Schoolab, it's a program where group of students of different schools build together a product to fufill a need of a company.


I worked with OPTIC 2000, on the following them : sport glasses. We had to design a product to generate more trafic in the shops around the glasses designed for sports

After getting different feedback from several shop and sellers, we found out that some shops do generate traffic linked to the sport glasses.

In order to unifed this to all the shops, we designed an application to teach to the sellers how to recommands this kind of product to the client, and what are the benefits of these glasses.

My role in this team composed by 4 others students was to add my technical point of view and how to optimize the application's features

## 2020 : OXIO : backend developer (6 months)

The year after, I worked again with the same company but in a more independant way. The project changed a lot after the end of my internship, and I was hired to fix a major bug in the system.

For some user of the application, the printed balance of money was not the same that stored in the databases of BrandVNO. The mission of my contract was to estimate the number of account touched by this missunderstanding and save some data in a Google Spreadsheet in order to share it with the team.

In order to monitore this issue, I did a Python script to request all the needed data for this tasks. Thanks to this mission I learned to develop correctly with Python3, and to deliver the cleanest code possible following the best practices like the pep8.

It was the 1st time for me that I used a public API, especially one Google, not the easiest API to have access, with the Auth2 process. But it was the first contact between me and an API.

It gave me more facility to process HTTP request and parse data. I also learned how to work more independantly and how to share progress on the task that I took care of.

## 2019 : OXIO : backend developer (6 months)

I started my 2nd year at EPITECH with this internship, I joined OXIO France for 5 months in 2019. During this period of time, I helped to build the main project of OXIO : BrandVNO.

At this time OXIO was a startup composed by 5 others developers and the main idea was the following : Propose, as a service, the possibility to companies to become a telecom. Using BrandVNO and the white label app developped by OXIO as well.

During these months of work, I learned a lot of things thanks to the caring team that I joined. The project was mainly developed in Golang, so I developped skills in this technologie.

The project was divided in microservices, and it gave me the opportunity to learn some details in the architecture, and explore some different choices across the project. Like there were different databases, but different technologies were used to fill specific needs. Thanks to this I learned how to use MySQL, PosgreSQL and MongoDB and to determine the strenght and weaknesses of all of them.

I discovered how to work efficently in a team of developer, using Confluence and especially Jira to manage the Sprints that we had. I had my 1st merge request at this company, and I learned how to beautify my code by following the best practices.
